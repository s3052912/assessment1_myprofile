  <div> <h1>Personal Information</h1>
<hr>
    <p>My name is Nelson Lay.<br> </p>
    <p>I am 37 years old and originally grew up in Melbourne, VIC, I have also spent time living and working in Toronto, Canada and am currently living in Sydney, NSW. <br> </p>
      I completed High School at Macleod College in 2002 and enrolled in the Advanced Diploma of Computer Science course at RMIT in 2003. Due to personal circumstances at the time,
      I didn't complete the course and after approximately 2.5 years I decided to take a study break and enter the workforce.<br>
    <p>This study break ended up stretching out to over 15 years and I am now finally making a return to study with a goal to complete what I started many years ago.<br></p>
      I have a pet rabbit named Chester, he has helped me adjust to the working from home lifestyle and is my new office buddy, keeping me company by sitting next to my desk all day long.</p>

      <h1>Interest in IT </h1>
<hr>
        <p> My interest in IT is in new innovate tech and gadgets, I often find myself reading about or watching a review on new tech/gadgets such as the latest
          smartphone or smartwatch, earbuds or headphones. Even though I rarely buy most of the items I watch or read about, there’s still something I find really
          cool with seeing all the latest innovations in tech.<br> </p>
        <p>This interested started in my early teenage years, I would have been in Year 7 at the time when things really kicked off and we got our first PC at home.
          Aside from being able to play basic games on it, such as Solitaire and Minesweeper, I loved the fact that I no longer had to handwrite school assignments
          anymore and could simply type it out and submit it on a floppy disk.<br></p>
        <p>The next step was when we finally got our first internet connection on a 28.8k dial-up modem, I was amazed at how much information I could find on the web.
          Ever since then I’ve had an interest in trying to keep up with new technologies and gadgets.<br> </P>
        <p>I chose to study at RMIT as it provided an online course option, which works well to balance with my work. I also like the choice of electives that were
          available through the Bachelor of IT course at RMIT. During my studies I’m expecting to learn how to be a programmer, learn more about database and cloud
          computing technologies. I’m also expecting to develop some of my soft skills such as presentation skills, managing projects and leading people. </p>
