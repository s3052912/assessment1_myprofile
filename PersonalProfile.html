  <h2> Myers-Briggs Test - 16 Personalities</h2>
    <p>URL: <a href = "https://www.16personalities.com/"> https://www.16personalities.com/ </a>
  <p>According to the Myers-Briggs test, my Personality type is an <strong>Adventurer</strong>
    Known for their kindness and artistic skills. Adventurers' are great at finding exciting new things to explore and experience.<br>
    Adventurers’ creativity and down-to-earth attitude are invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth.
    Yet Adventurers can be easily tripped up in areas where their focus on practical matters is more of a liability than an asset.</p>

  <h2>Learning Style Test – How to Study </h2>
  <p>URL: <a href = "https://www.how-to-study.com/learning-style-assessment/"> https://www.how-to-study.com/learning-style-assessment/ </a>
  <p>According to the How-to-Study learning style test, my Learning Style is a <strong>Tactile/Kinesthetic</strong> Learner.<br></p>
  <p>Tactile/Kinesthetic learners learn best when they can use their sense of touch and can move about. Being a Tactile/Kinesthetic learner, the following suggestions that can help me to succeed in school to the best of my ability.<br>
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be physically active while you study. Rather than just sit at your desk, occasionally walk back and forth with your textbook or notes as you read the information out loud.
      <li>To decrease your fidgeting as you study, listen to music, preferably baroque music. However, discontinue this if you find the music to be distracting.
      <li>Make extensive use of a computer and the Internet. Actively touching the keyboard will keep your mind active.
      <li>Take extensive written notes in class. Edit and type them later.
      <li>Study in short blocks of time with frequent but short breaks.
      <li>Do something physical as you study such as tapping a pencil or squeezing a stress ball.
      <li>Use your finger as a guide while reading.
      <li>Act out things you have to learn whenever possible.
      <li>Construct models of things you have to learn whenever possible.
      <li>If you find it difficult to sit at a desk when studying, trying lying on your stomach or back.
      <li>When trying to remember information, close your eyes and "write" the information in the air. Picture the information in your mind as you do so.
      <li>Use concrete objects to help you understand math concepts.
      <li>When trying to learn the spelling of a difficult word, arrange letter blocks to spell the word.
    </ul>

  <h2>Creativity Test – MindTools </h2>
  <p>URL: <a href = "https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/creativity-quiz.htm"> https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/creativity-quiz.htm </a> </p>
  <p>According to the MindTools creativity test, I scored a 48 which puts me in the bracket ‘Your creativity is a <em>work in progress</em>'<br></p>
  <p>You've had some successes, so now it's time to let loose and stretch yourself. Share your ideas and perspectives with others, and ask them how they view problems.<br></p>
  <p>Adopt a collaborative approach to problem finding, and work actively with others to create and innovate.</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The results of the tests tell me that I lean slightly more towards being an introvert, which means in a group team setting I may at times hold back from
    speaking up and let others do more of the talking. I think this is a trait that I can improve on and spend more time in team settings to find more comfort in speaking up.<br> </p>
  <p>The tests also tell me that I’m a Tactile learner, which I agree with as I always learn better after actually doing something. In a team setting, I would prefer to engage with
    others in a practical hands-on way. This may be through screen sharing, where we can see each other working in real-time or have a visual component to it rather than just
    straight verbal communication.<br> </p>
  <p>My creativity levels are right in the middle, with room to improve. When forming a team I should look for a good balance of personalities, with a team that I can
    openly share ideas and collaborate with. Just enough extroverts to provide productive feedback for my ideas, but not too many extroverts that may dominate team meetings.</p>
